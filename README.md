# 👋 Hello, I'm Karol!

## 🌐 About Me
I'm a passionate web developer with a focus on JavaScript and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). I love building dynamic and interactive web applications that provide a great user experience.

## 📚 Education and Training
I recently completed an excellent web development course on Udemy taught by Colt Steele, where I gained a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This course helped me develop a deep understanding of web development principles and best practices.

## 💻 Current Project
Currently, I'm working on a project called Odin, which is part of my ongoing learning journey. It allows me to put my skills to the test and apply what I've learned from the course. I'm excited to dive deeper into JavaScript and explore its vast ecosystem, including Node.js for server-side development, Express.js for building APIs, and Webpack for module bundling.

## ⚡ Skills and Technologies
In addition to JavaScript, I have experience working with HTML and CSS to create well-structured and visually appealing web pages. I also enjoy utilizing modern tools like Webpack to optimize and bundle my code, providing efficient and scalable solutions.

## 🔨 Future Goals
As I continue my web development journey, I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies and frameworks to enhance my skills. I'm particularly interested in front-end frameworks like React, which I plan to master in the future.

## 🌟 Other Interests
Outside of web development, I have a few other interests that bring balance to my life. I enjoy staying fit and healthy, so you'll often find me working out or going for a run. I'm also passionate about cooking and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. In my downtime, I love watching movies from various genres, immersing myself in captivating stories. And when I want to unwind, I pick up my guitar and strum some tunes.
